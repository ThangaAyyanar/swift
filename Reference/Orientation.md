# To check the device orientation in swift we check the following property

              UIDevice.current.orientation.isLandscape -> return true when user in landscape orientation
              
              we can do this similar to portrait direction also
              
              UIDevice.current.orientation.isLandscape -> return Boolean

              Note:
                This property can be used in "willTransition" function
